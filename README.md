## Requirements to use this repo
  1- run "pip install -r requirements.txt" command in your virtual environment"

## Note
Time series model file is not in the repo because file was large to upload, when you will run the code or flask server,
model will start training and model file will be saved in your project repo so you don't need to worry about model file.
